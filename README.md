# JavaScript Learning Log

This repository records my JavaScript learning process.

## Purpose
- Build a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
- Focus on core concepts, not frameworks
- Learn by writing code and testing ideas

## Structure
- Each folder represents one learning day or topic
- Code is written by me for practice and understanding
- Topics progress from basic to more advanced

Example:
- day01-variables
- day02-if-else
- day10-array-methods
- day20-async-await

## Notes
- Code may be simple or repetitive by design
- Some files include comments about mistakes or insights
- This repo reflects my learning journey, not polished production code
